# Create a lock-in feature in AWS Cognito.

I wanto to show you how to extend AWS Cognito functionality by using a Lambda function.

In this example I am going to create a trigger that lock an account after trying to log in X without success in a period of Y seconds. 

When an account gets locked you minimized the risks of a brute force of dictionary based attacks.

I am going to use Redis to store any loging attempt and will use the email as the key.
